Group QC report generated using eddy squad v1.0.2

When using eddy and its QC tools, we ask you to please reference the papers describing the different aspects of the modelling and corrections. The (Andersson & Sotiropoulos, 2016) paper is the main eddy reference and should always be be cited when using eddy. The (Bastiani et al., 2019) paper is the main eddy QC reference and should always be be cited when using the QC tools. When using topup to estimate a fieldmap prior to running eddy one should also cite (Andersson et al., 2003). If you have used eddy to detect and replace outlier slices (by adding --repol to the eddy command line), please also cite (Andersson et al., 2016). If eddy was used to estimate and correct for intra-volume (slice-to-vol) movement by specifying --mporder, please also cite (Andersson et al., 2017). Finally, if you asked eddy to model how the susceptibility-induced distortions change as a consequence of subject movement (with the --estimate_move_by_susceptibility flag), please cite (Andersson et al., 2018).
